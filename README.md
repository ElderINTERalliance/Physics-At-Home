# Physics-At-Home
The start of a project and app to make learning and teaching physics more interactive and easier, all from the comfort of your own home pc (or I guess wherever else you want to be :P )

This was our 2023 Techolympics Showcase project. The program was written to run in Love2D, a cross-platform game framework that uses the coding language Lua.
To run this project, either wait for an official packaged release or open the main.lua in Love2D.

The project as of now is very unfinished and some of the features may be disabled because of testing purposes at the time of the commit

The goal of this project is to bring an easy and fast application that allows you to see and apply principles of 2D physics and learn from it with the lab builder or downloading packs from the internet or, if this project takes off, we may host several pre-built physics lessons to learn as a course.
